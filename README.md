## What is the Delphi Web API?

It is the primary access point to the Delphi system.

## How does it work?

The Delphi Web API communicates with the underlying Elasticsearch database to provide access to data.

## How can I use it?

If you just wish to query the results, maybe the public instance at https://delphi.cs.uni-paderborn.de is the right choice for you.

If you want to run your own infrastructure, you can start the web API
```
sbt run
```

It expects a running instance of elasticsearch on port 9200 on the same machine.
